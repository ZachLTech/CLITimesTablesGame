## Description :scroll:

    This is a (as of now) CLI based game that prompts 3 different time table modes (1-5's, 1-10's, and 1-15's) that gives you random multiplication questions to answer as fast as possible
    - The goal of this program is to build better muscle memory for your multiplication tables (if you don't already know them)
    - Made entirely with python


## Requirements :wrench:

- **Python**
    - Library: inputimeout

## Installation :floppy_disk:

- If you want to try this simple game out yourself, just clone the repository and run *main.py* for a CLI version
- I plan to make this a web based game in the near future to which I'll add the link here

## TODO (Eventually) :eyes:

~~- Make an optional timer per question~~
- make a mode to see how many you can get within a certain time limit

- have some sort of congratulations per so many questions correct
- Make an optional question limit that gets larger with shorter times as you progress through the game (basically lives)


- setup a website to put this on 
- use CSS to make it look good and have a box to run the python 
    - possibly use tkinter to give it GUI
